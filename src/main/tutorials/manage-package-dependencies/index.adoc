NOTE: This tutorial is written for version 1.9.1 of jQAssistant.

== Overview

The desired architecture of a Java project is usually described using terms like `Component`, `Module` or `Layer` and allowed dependencies between them.
During implementation such elements must be mapped to code structures.

One approach for this is using packages, e.g. packages at a defined level are assigned the role of a `Component`.
Furthermore each of such component might require a defined internal structure like providing a dedicated API which again is represented by a package.

For the tutorial the following package layout is used:

[source,raw]
----
your.project        <1>

your.project.a      <2>
your.project.a.api  <3>
your.project.a.impl

your.project.b
your.project.b.api
your.project.b.impl

your.project.c
your.project.c.api
your.project.c.impl
----
<1> The root package of the project is `your.project`, i.e. all packages and Java types are located within this package.
<2> A package located directly within the root package represents a `Component`.
The project consists of three components `a`, `b` and `c` with the following defined dependencies: `b` -> `a` and `c` -> `a`.
Any other dependency is not allowed as well as circular dependencies between components, e.g. `a` -> `b` -> `a`.
<3> Each component is structured into an `api` and `impl` package.
Only types in the `api` packages may be used as dependency by other components to hide implementation details.

The described structural rules shall be defined and verified by jQAssistant.

== Integrate jQAssistant Into The Build Process

The tutorial uses https://maven.apache.org[Apache Maven] for building the project.

jQAssistant is enabled by adding the plugin to the build/plugins section of the file `pom.xml`.

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
include::pom.xml[tag=plugin,indent=0]
----

TIP: To verify the setup a build should be triggered at this point using `mvn verify`.
The output should contain scan and analysis messages by jQAssistant.

NOTE: Beside the plugin and execution declarations no further configuration is required for this tutorial.

The rules will be written as Asciidoc documents which must be located in the folder `jqassistant/`.

For this tutorial the following files are created:

[source,raw]
-----
jqassistant/index.adoc      <1>
jqassistant/structure.adoc  <2>
-----
<1> link:jqassistant/index.adoc[index.adoc] is the root document, includes both other documents and defines the group `default` which is executed by the jQAssistant Maven plugin.
<2> link:jqassistant/structure.adoc[structure.adoc] contains the concepts and constraints for verifying the described package structure .

TIP: For setting up and verifying rules it is convenient to run a build with the jQAssistant Maven plugin (see above) and start the integrated server using `mvn jqassistant:server`.
The Neo4j browser will then be available under http://localhost:7474[] for executing the queries interactively.

== Identify Components And Define Dependencies

First a concept is defined that identifies the root package of the application and adds a label `Component` to all packages which are contained in it.
The list of components is returned by the rule:

[source,asciidoc]
....
include::jqassistant/structure.adoc[tag=structureComponent]
....

Both production code from `src/main/java` and test code from `src/test/java` are scanned by the jQAssistant Maven plugin.
The described rules only apply to production code which is contained in an artifact labeled with `Main`.

NOTE: Test code is identified by the label `Test`.

Based on the identified components allowed dependencies can be defined by adding relationships of type `DEFINES_COMPONENT_DEPENDENCY`.
This is implemented by the concept `structure:DefinedComponentDependencies`:

[source,asciidoc]
....
include::jqassistant/structure.adoc[tag=structureDefinedComponentDependencies]
....

NOTE: The concept returns an aggregated result, i.e. exactly one row created by `count(*)`.
For correct verification by jQAssistant `verify=aggregation` needs to be specified.
This strategy checks the value of the first column (i.e. `Count`) to be greater than 0.
If omitted the default behavior would apply and verify that at least one row is returned.

== Identify Existing Dependencies

The concept `structure:ComponentDependencies` determines the actual dependencies on type level and aggregates them to component level:

[source,asciidoc]
....
include::jqassistant/structure.adoc[tag=structureComponentDependencies]
....

NOTE: The asterisk in the `CONTAINS` patterns of the `MATCH` clause is used to collect all types within a component through all contained package levels.

TIP: The `DEPENDS_ON_COMPONENT` relationships are enriched by a property `weight` which is the count of all type dependencies.
This value can be used as an indicator for the degree of coupling between two components.

== Verify Existing Against Defined Dependencies

At this point all required information is available for setting up a constraint `structure:UndefinedComponentDependencies`.
This rule verifies that for each `DEPENDS_ON_COMPONENT` relationship between two components also a relationship `DEFINES_COMPONENT_DEPENDENCY` exists.
If it is not present then the types creating this unwanted dependency are identified and returned:

[source,asciidoc]
....
include::jqassistant/structure.adoc[tag=structureUndefinedComponentDependencies]
....

A similar constraint may used to verify if a dependency between components is defined but no dependency exists in the code.
This situation is less critical but it is recommendable to remove such obsolete definitions:

[source,asciidoc]
....
include::jqassistant/structure.adoc[tag=structureUnusedComponentDependencies]
....

== Prevent Cyclic Dependencies

A cyclic dependency may occur if a component indirectly references itself as a dependency, e.g. `a` -> `b` -> `a`.
Such cycles should be considered as a serious problem because they decrease comprehensibility of the application and make refactorings or restructurings complicated.

Using the rules explained above unwanted cycles are prevented under the condition that the defined dependencies are cycle-free.
But in larger projects consisting of many components it may happen that this problem is introduced by accident into the definition itself.
For this reason an additional constraint `structure:CyclicComponentDependencies` helps detecting such situation early:

[source,asciidoc]
....
include::jqassistant/structure.adoc[tag=structureCyclicComponentDependencies]
....

== API And Implementation

The packages containing APIs and implementations of all components can be identified by the concepts `structure:Api` and `structure:Impl`:

[source,asciidoc]
....
include::jqassistant/structure.adoc[tag=structureApi]
include::jqassistant/structure.adoc[tag=structureImpl]
....

The concepts add labels `Api` and `Impl` which can now be used to define constraints.
To prevent unintentional leaking of implementation details the constraint `structure:ApiMustNotDependOnImpl` verifies that a component's API does not depend on its implementation:

[source,asciidoc]
....
include::jqassistant/structure.adoc[tag=structureApiMustNotDependOnImpl]
....

The following constraint `structure:ComponentDependencyMustUseApi` ensures that only API types of components are used to create dependencies:

[source,asciidoc]
....
include::jqassistant/structure.adoc[tag=structureComponentDependencyMustUseApi]
....

== Activate The Rules

For execution the constraints should be included within a group.
The file link:jqassistant/structure.adoc[] therefore defines `structure:Default`:

[source,asciidoc]
....
include::jqassistant/structure.adoc[tag=structureDefault]
....

This group itself is included within the group `default` that is defined in link:jqassistant/index.adoc[] and executed by default:

[source,asciidoc]
....
include::jqassistant/index.adoc[tag=default]
....

TIP: The shown approach of building up a hierarchy between groups is the recommended way of organizing rules.
It's also possible to reference rules to be executed directly within the jQAssistant Maven plugin configuration.
