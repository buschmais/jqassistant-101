This tutorial shows you how you can use jQAssistant in a Maven project by integrating the jQAssistant Plugin.
// end::lead[]

NOTE: This tutorial is written for version 1.3.0 of jQAssistant.
In further versions of jQAssistant some aspects might changed.


== Add the Plugin to the Maven POM

Open the top-level `pom.xml` of your project in any editor and add a property called `jqassistant.version` to the properties of your Maven project. It is a good pratice to managed version information
with the help of properties.
So you can migrate to a newer version by just changing the property value.

.Definition of the jQAssistant version to use
[source,xml]
----
include::pom.xml[tag=prop,indent=0]
----

Now add the plugin to the plugin management section of the `pom.xml`.

.Declaration of the jQAssistant Maven plugin
[source,xml]
----
include::pom.xml[tag=pm,indent=0]
----

Now Maven knows that you would like to use the jQAssistant Plugin for Maven and which version of it.
Furthermore basic configuration is provided

* the goals that should be executed by default
* the severities for log warnings or failing about if rules have failed during analysis

To activate the plugin during the build you must add it to the plugin section.

== Running the plugin during the build

Using the shown configuration jQAssistant will be executed during a normal Maven build.

TIP: If you want skip the execution of jQAssistant for any reason you can run Maven with `-Djqassistant.skip`.

jQAssistant will create during its run a new directory `jqassistant/store` below the created `target` directory.
It contains the Neo4j database with the result of the jQAssistant's scan.

== Accessing the generated database

The Maven plugin also contains a goal called `server`.
Running the plugin with this goal runs an embedded Neo4j server and makes the Neo4j web console available.
On of the last lines of the output contains the server and port of the web console.
